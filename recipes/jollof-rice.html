        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Sliced Onions</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Maggi</li>
        <li>Fresh meat and fish</li>
        <li>Groundnut oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Cooking instructions</h1>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Wash the rice with clean water and perboil it for about
         5 minutes or as as soon as it starts to boil, drain out the boiling water with a fitter.
        Then put the perboiled rice in a fitter and cover it to prevent flies </p>
    
   
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Boil the fresh meat and fish  on the same pot after rinsing or you can use a 
        clean pot  and add tomato paste to the mixture. Stir the mixture so that the paste dissolves. 
        Add salt, sliced onions, maggi, pepper as desired and leave to boil  for about twenty minutes.
    Then remove the fish and meat from the mixture and put a clean frying pan on the fire 
    put some quantity of groundnut oil in the frying pan and heat briefly. Add the fish and meat carefully 
    to avoid splashing of oil as well as 
    getting burnt by the hot oil. After sometime when it is fully fried, and dried, remove the frying pan from 
    the fire and remove the fish and meat gradually. </p>   
   
    
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Put the pot containing the tomatoe mixture on the fire then pour the hot groundnut 
        oil used in frying the meat and fish into the tomato pot and also pour the perboiled rice from the filter into the 
        mixture and add water. Then continue to cook for sometime, covering
        the pot and finally add the fried meat and fish and remove the food from fire
        when the it is getting dried and serve while hot </p>
